# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

This project contains a solution to the second project of udacity Deep-Reinforcement-Learning nano-degree, which trains the double-jointed arm to move along given target locations

![Trained Agent][image1]

### Environment details

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

In this project, there are two separate versions of the Unity environment:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment. 

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30.

Here, the second version of the enviroment which contains 20 identical agents is used when trainningï¼Œ While the first version of the enviroment which contains one agent is used when playing. 

### Getting Started

1. Clone the DRLND Repository and follow the instructions in the [DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning) to set up your Python environment. 

2. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
